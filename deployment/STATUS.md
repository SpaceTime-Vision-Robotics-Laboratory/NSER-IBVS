## 📁 GitHub Actions Workflow

Created `.github/workflows/github-pages.yml` with automated deployment that:

- ✅ Triggers on push to main branch
- ✅ Supports manual workflow dispatch
- ✅ Uses proper permissions for GitHub Pages
- ✅ Sets up Ruby and Jekyll
- ✅ Creates Gemfile automatically if not present
- ✅ Builds with proper base path
- ✅ Deploys to GitHub Pages

## 🔧 Configuration Files Added

1. **Gemfile** - Jekyll dependencies
2. **Updated .gitignore** - Excludes build artifacts
3. **Updated _config.yml** - Added jekyll-sitemap plugin
4. **deploy-config.yml** - Comprehensive deployment settings

## 🚀 How to Deploy
